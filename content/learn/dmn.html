<p class="lead">
    The Decision Model and Notation (DMN™) is a Standard by OMG® providing a common and visual notation readily
    understandable by all users and personas.
    With DMN, business analysts can define the initial decision requirements and then formalize more detailed decision
    models; technical developers can automate the decisions in any process with a portable execution semantic, while
    business stakeholders can manage and monitor those decisions.

            <p>
                DMN is trying to do for Business Decision Management what BPMN did for Business Process Management a
                decade ago: empower the business to take charge of the logic that drives its operations, through a
                vendor-independent diagramming language.
                To be effective, that language must be both usable by business analysts and stakeholders in the business
                and verifiable for completeness and consistency.
                DMN is both.
