  == Community and product comparison

  The community download delivers everything you would expect from an Open Source project,
  including all features. Both https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/decision-manager[Red Hat Decision Manager] and
  https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/process-automation-manager[Red Hat Process Automation Manager]
  are Red Hat products based on Drools. The subscription to these products fills the missing gaps for enterprise use.
  Both community and product use the same code base.
