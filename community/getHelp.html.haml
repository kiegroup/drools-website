      ==  Guidelines

      * Answers can take a while. Wait at least an hour. If no one answers, then they are busy or AFK. Try the forum instead.
      * Don't send private messages to anyone, use only the public channels. Private support is reserved for link:../product/services.html[Red Hat customers] only.
      * No need to waste time by asking _"Can I ask a question?"_. Just ask your question immediately.
      * If you need assistance with other JBoss projects, try their IRC channel on Freenode.
